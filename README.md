CI/CD Pipeline â€“ Jenkins

This repository includes a Jenkins pipeline that automates the full application lifecycle: from code integration and quality analysis to containerization, security scanning, and deployment.

ðŸ“Œ Pipeline Workflow â€“ Step-by-Step
Below are the pipeline stages in the exact sequence they execute:

1. Tool Install

Installs required development tools like:

JDK 17 (for Java-based apps)

Node.js 16 (for frontend/JavaScript)

Ensures consistent runtime environments.

2. Clean

Cleans the workspace and removes previous build artifacts to ensure a fresh build.

3. Code

Checks out or executes the application code.

May include linting, basic tests, or version setup.

4. SonarQube Analysis

Performs static code analysis using SonarQube.

Identifies:

Bugs

Code smells

Vulnerabilities

Requires SonarQube server and token setup.

5. Quality Gates

Evaluates the SonarQube report.

Fails the pipeline if quality metrics like coverage or bugs exceed thresholds.

6. Install Dependencies

Installs project dependencies (e.g., using npm, pip, or maven).

Prepares for secure and successful builds.

7. OWASP Dependency-Check

Scans for known CVEs in libraries using OWASP.

Helps meet industry-level security compliance.

8. Trivy Scan

Performs a security scan on the applicationâ€™s source using Trivy.

Detects vulnerable OS packages and third-party tools.

9. Dockerfile

Builds a Docker image using the project's Dockerfile.

10. Docker Build & Push

Builds the Docker image.

Tags and pushes the image to a remote Docker registry like:

Docker Hub

AWS ECR

GitHub Container Registry

11. Scan Image

Scans the built Docker image for security issues (e.g., misconfigurations or OS-level CVEs).

12. Deploy

Deploys the image to a cloud environment or Kubernetes cluster.

This step can be extended for:

Helm charts

EC2 provisioning

ECS/EKS deployments
